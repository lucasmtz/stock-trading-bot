# stock-trading-bot

Stock trading bot written in python that evaluates active stocks and buy/sells undervalued and up-trending stocks based on day trading patterns and news sentiment analysis.

## How does it work?

This code for this bot can be broken into 3 different parts:

1. Web scrapes active stocks from yahoo finance.
2. Evaluates active stocks (can evaluate 100s of stocks per minute as the application is multithreaded) using different strategies such as EMA crossovers/resistance breakthroughs, regression stock direction testing, and news sentiment analysis (buys and sells stocks based on quarterly earnings information or big news!).
3. Evaluates current stock portfolio by checking if any stock no longer seems worth holding.
4. Sends buy and sell requests using the alpaca paper trading api

That's it!

### Why create and use a stock-trading-bot

- Evaluates good opportunities faster than a human can by evaluating multiple stocks simultaneously.
- Takes the emotions out of the equation.
- No time commitment after the bot has been setup.
